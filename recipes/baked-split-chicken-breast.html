    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
      <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, 0.25 cups</li>
      <li>Garlic, minced, 0.5tsp</li>
      <li>Sea salt, coarse, 0.5tsp</li>
      <li>Black Pepper, cracked, 0.5tsp</li>
      <li>Rosemary, dried, 0.25tsp</li>
      <li>Basil, dried, 0.25tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black
        pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in a large baking dish and
        refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the
        bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast meat should read
        165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Plate and serve.</li>
    </ol>
